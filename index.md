# **The LCB Global Network - How it will work**

## **The Local Climate Bank**

A Local Climate Bank is a dedicated, specialized nonprofit finance entity, serving a defined local area, that:

(1)	is designed to drive private capital into market gaps for low- and zero-emission goods and services, and to restore the health of the environment;

(2)	uses finance tools to mitigate climate change and environmental degradation while enhancing local resilience;

(3)	does not take deposits;

(4)	is funded primarily by private (non-accredited) householder investors living within its service area, and secondarily by investments from governments, institutions and private entities; and

(5)	invests—

(a) alone; or

(b) in conjunction with other investors.

A Local Climate Bank as defined above is very similar to the definition of a “[green bank](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/116/s2057/text)” as defined in the US [Climate Bank Act](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/116/s2057/text) before the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works (Dec. 2019).

The most important task of the national branches of the Community Climate Investment Foundation (“CCIF”) that we are proposing is to enroll carefully vetted, trusted and trustworthy elders in communities to establish a Local Climate Bank. Those elders bring together other willing local leaders to form ****an LCB as a participating member of the LCB Global Network, and can count on the expert support of the CCIF, which may include startup funding. Later, these elders will lead concerned and willing members of the community in pooling a significant portion of their personal funds into a series of *local* impact investment Funds designed to have maximum impact on climate change and environmental degradation, while improving the economic and environmental resilience of their communities and providing investors a financial return on their investments.

Each Investment Fund offered to the community by an LCB is composed of a basket of investments into businesses, or into the

*for-profit*

projects of nonprofits—all within its local geography. Funds will generally be Debenture Funds.

The bounded geography of an LCB service area ideally includes an urban centre together with its surrounding ecosystem services area. The LCB may obtain assistance from the CCIF in identifying the most important climate and environmental impact goals for it to take aim at, and then may get assistance with identifying (or creating) investment opportunities (“Projects”) which will have the greatest impact on achieving their selected impact goal (or goals). Assistance will also be offered to structure a term sheet for each Project investment which is to be part of its Investment Fund offering, followed by the due diligence each deal requires, if accepted.

Investors into the resultant LCB Fund will be of two classes:

1. The primary investors for LCBs are individuals with acceptable identification proving that they reside within the LCB service area. Dominantly but not exclusively, they will be non-accredited investors, including both the middle class and poor. These investors may be offered lower-risk, lower-reward coupons in debenture Investment Funds, coupons which will not be available to the second class of investors.
2. The second class of investors are **non-local investors, and may be corporate or government investors**. If individuals, they must be proven accredited investors. They may invest in higher-risk, higher-reward coupons in an LCB Investment Fund.

Like private investment management companies, LCBs must sustain themselves by collecting a management fee for their service, charged to the investors in the series of investment funds they create. In economically well-developed areas, LCBs will charge an additional 0.5% to their investment funds to fund the global CCIF and its national-level branch offices. **The actual fee structure required to sustain LCBs and the global CCIF will be determined by developing the business plan and model with the support of the seed funding grant now being sought.

## **LCB Global Network: Certification and Governance**

Similar to Fair Trade coffee or Forest Stewardship Council certification of organizations, LCBs will be bound to one another and the CCIF and through a Memorandum of Understanding requiring adherence to the financial management discipline defined in the LCB Finance and Accounting Manual and to the LCB Statement of Values, in keeping with The Earth Charter. LCBs regularly elect an **LCB Global Network Council** from among their leaders, which forms an important part of the Board of Advisors of the Community Climate Investment Foundation (“CCIF”).

The CCIF admits, and may de-certify LCBs based upon independent auditor’s advice; enforces allowed use of the LCB emblem under the authority of the MOU each LCB has signed; recommends vetted expert scientific and regenerative/sustainable investment advisory support; provides LCB branding guidance and marketing support; creates and maintains common LCB information network and technology tools; facilitates add-on investment, data-sharing and other partnerships with NGOs, DFIs and relevant state and multilateral organizations; advocates for supportive regulatory environments for LCBs—all for the benefit of the LCB Global Network and its communities.

[https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/54df0gZdA1x0OdBp0uC3v7G_-TiJt8Z3xln2AFDLgLeF5rKRrqFRjjCSa3pfz9MRJnionNqsRYatCxNGEdR5BnnryHi-5zdDJ-hcaZW7FJflKUK7QWWEgiRNSbdMYOhibxnddtox](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/54df0gZdA1x0OdBp0uC3v7G_-TiJt8Z3xln2AFDLgLeF5rKRrqFRjjCSa3pfz9MRJnionNqsRYatCxNGEdR5BnnryHi-5zdDJ-hcaZW7FJflKUK7QWWEgiRNSbdMYOhibxnddtox)

Note that LCBs will be directly in communication with one another and may elect to develop projects together and to form collaborative groups according to region, size and economic type, language and culture, or other. The CCIF will be a supporting entity, and an enforcer of operational standards for certification of member LCB organizations. Audits of LCBs will be performed by third-party auditors.

## **LCB-supporting Technology, Infrastructure and Services**

For the benefit of LCBs, the CCIF will create and support a trustworthy global social and information services network connecting and serving LCBs, their investors and partners, creating a fast-learning and adaptation environment in which stakeholders support each other in effective activity to reduce GHG emissions and to restore and enhance the health of their local environmental ecosystems. The creation of a supporting technology layer for the LCB Global Network necessarily involves:

**1. Standardized LCB local office productivity and accounting software and services.** 

**2. An LCB-standard mobile+web investment app** This software tool will facilitate the **secure gathering of investments** and transparent movement of these into investments on terms as contracted: KYC data about investors; tracking financial returns on investments (as contracted) to investors, ensuring contracted transfers and investment returns to and from investees, and providing information about impacts projected and achieved. All to be overseen by the CCIF, and accessible to independent auditing firms contracted by the CCIF.

**3. A powerful and accessible LCB Global Information Network** The LCB Global Information Network will support the following functions:

**A. Investment Projects - Sharing and Discovery.** 

LCBs should be able to share and discover under-consideration, underway or completed Projects, so that they can copy or adapt them for use in their own local area. A standard template for Project descriptions would be enforced to facilitate search and discovery of the most relevant opportunities by any community or potential investment partners by both impact goal and business investment criteria.

**B.** **Organizational form and methods - Sharing and Discovery.** 

LCBs should be able to copy or adapt organizational models and methods for use in their own local area. Similar models would be grouped, and tagged with regional, cultural and other characteristics to facilitate easier discovery of models that might apply in any given local context.

**C. Collaboration and communication.**

**D.**

**Community and regional information dashboards**

showing LCBs and their community members their situation in context, showing the actual and anticipated impact of their investments on GHG emissions and environmental health measures, the financial returns to LCB investors (aggregated) and their economic and other impacts on their community.

[https://docs.google.com/drawings/u/0/d/sVJlKOzEP5m2boK2j2M2L3Q/image?w=180&h=5&rev=1&ac=1&parent=1f2sdfn_qDc4iCIefltVHHyzGKA4sGYUsHh8HLHj2Wgg](https://docs.google.com/drawings/u/0/d/sVJlKOzEP5m2boK2j2M2L3Q/image?w=180&h=5&rev=1&ac=1&parent=1f2sdfn_qDc4iCIefltVHHyzGKA4sGYUsHh8HLHj2Wgg)

As time moves forward and our climate and environmental challenges increase, we expect LCB successes and these dashboards will shift householder mindsets to become more *community + environment*-focused, rather than modern societies’ usual *self + immediate* *family* focus

Some alternative LCB dashboards:

**E.** **Access for vetted third-party *investors*** **to the LCB information network** so they can communicate with LCB leaders and discover LCB projects they may wish to invest in. LCBs offer potential ‘deal pipelines’ for impact investors and development finance institutions.

**F.** **Access for vetted third-party data and other *service providers*** **to the LCB information network** to offer data and information partnerships with LCBs on a donated or business basis. LCBs may wish to collect and share local data on climate, environmental and economic factors in order to receive useful information, services and/or income from these partners in return, helping LCBs and the rest of their local community members to make personal and community economic action decisions with the best available data. Some partners could also offer project templates for the evaluation of LCBs in their investment plans.

**G.** **Access for national and regional *governments*** **to the LCB information network** to gather aggregate (and validated) data on regional LCB contributions to Nationally Determined Contributions for GHG reduction, and to other government policy targets related to their climate change, environmental, social and economic change targets.

## The Community Climate Investment Foundation (“CCIF”)

The CCIF will be there to help create and support successful LCBs through the network it will build and support, and will do so directly through national in-country offices.

**Through its global office, the CCIF will:**

- Develop and propose an annual strategic plan and budget for approval by the CCIF Board of Directors.
- Manage and protect the trademarks and intellectual property of the LCB Global Network, including the use of its Emblem by LCBs and partner organizations,
- Work to establish and grow partnerships for the LCB Global Network with aligned global and regional institutional ecosystem players, supporting them in their work where it aligns with the mission and goals of the LCB Global Network;
- Manage and develop the technology and information services supporting the work and impact of LCBs throughout the world in partnership with technology partners;
- Work with state regulators to enable LCBs to operate effectively in their jurisdictions;
- Develop and share frameworks for the selection of LCB climate and environmental impact targets guided by the best science available―when possible in harmony with government policy―and for the selection of regional scientific advisors to help support LCBs in choosing those targets;
- Develop and share guiding frameworks for individual regenerative and sustainable investments, and for the selection of regional business and investment advisors to advise and support LCBs;
- Develop and maintain community eco-health information dashboards for local and regional use;
- Create and maintain global communications campaigns to help LCBs gain investment participation and public support in their communities, to inspire community leaders to start LCBs and partner organizations to work with them, and to communicate the impacts LCBs are making for the benefit of their communities around the world;
- Develop internal training and communications materials for LCBs in the languages needed;
- Manage independent audits of LCB adherence to the LCB Memorandum of Understanding, identify to the LCB Global Network Council high-performing LCBs, and those which may need to be disciplined or expelled;
- Capture and promote the evolving culture and story of LCBs around the world;
- Prudently steward the finances of the CCIF and report on the impacts and financial returns of LCBs;
- Grow and maintain reserve funds for investment in LCB startups.

**In-country CCIF branch offices**:

With the support of the global CCIF, in-country offices will,

- Identify trusted and trustworthy elders in communities and recruit them to start an LCB;
- Channel startup funding to new LCBs meeting all requirements;
- On the request of regional LCB leaders, interface with national and regional governments to help LCBs align with their agendas where possible;
- On the request of regional LCB leaders, help address any regulatory barriers to their operations.
- On a national cost-recovery basis, in-country CCIFs will:
- Provide LCBs access to vetted regional independent scientific and policy advice helping them to choose their impact targets;
- Provide LCBs access to vetted regional independent expert investment advice helping them to identify investment vehicles to achieve their impact targets and to compose their investment funds;
- Provide LCBs direct support with management advice, accounting, legal, statistical, fund marketing and community development expertise.

# **The LCB Global Network: Our Theory of Change**

How do we believe the LCB Global Network could be instrumental in stopping climate change, and restoring the health of the natural environment?

We believe our program will work in four specific ways:

- first, by large-scale GHG emissions reductions, improvements to biodiversity and enhancements of community resilience caused by the direct investments of *new money* by many local climate, adding very significantly to global investment on the climate and ecological fronts;
- second, by the added behavioural impact participating in LCB investments will have on greening personal lifestyles in a community;
- third, by drawing in governmental-level and major institutional investment, and by providing institutional green investors with channels to participate in many good local projects.
- fourth, by financially fueling some of the global network of change agents working toward climate and environmental mitigation and adaptation.

We want a world which stays within the boundary of the Paris Target of no more than 1.5 degrees of heating by 2030. **To accomplish this, [Axios Research](https://www.axios.com/climate-change-costs-wealth-carbon-tax-303d7cff-3085-49d9-accb-ec77689b9911.html) says that mitigating risks from Climate Change alone require steady, effective investment of $45T over the years between 2016 and 2035.

Our primary focus is not on 2030, but five years earlier in 2025. What must we have achieved by 2025, midway between now and 2030, in order to be able realistically to reach the Paris Targets? World-wide, we must then be in the middle of society-wide transition to truly sustainable--even regenerative--economies, from bottom to top. Below is our contribution to how we all get there: our **Theory of Change**.

**IMPACT VECTOR A: (Direct Impact)Direct householder climate and environment impact investment of $6 Trillion USD by 2025.**

LCBs will **directly** reduce CO2 emissions, help restore biodiversity and improve communities' resilience in the face of the already coming changes by channeling community investment into:

- renewable energy generation (electricity generation, air and water heating/cooling, transportation, and rural off-grid),
- building and vehicular retrofits to reduce energy demand,
- improved and sustainable public transportation,
- regenerative agriculture and agroforestry,
- protected areas on land and water,
- conservation of freshwater,
- business value chain changes increasing circularity, reducing consumption and reducing production of waste.

**IMPACT VECTOR B: (Indirect Impact)**

**Personal lifestyle behaviour changes**

*“If you want to teach people a new way of thinking, don't bother trying to teach them. Instead, give them a tool, the use of which will lead to new ways of thinking.”* ― Richard Buckminster Fuller

Investing a significant share of one’s personal financial resources is a major, attention-riveting action. The strong gravitational influence of an individual investor’s own significant financial investments in LCB impact funds will lead them to learn as much as they can about the rationale for the projects their fund is invested in. People will talk to others about their investments, why they wisely made them, and what impacts they will have on the community. LCB investments anchor an individual’s commitment to climate and environment in a community, leading to increased awareness and lifestyle behaviour changes.

We will also provide a widely-shared *dashboard* for community health showing the anticipated and actual impact of these investments on it. We expect that this will, together with the generally worsening local impacts of climate change and environmental degradation, alter the balance of priorities in householder investors' minds towards community environmental health goals versus purely personal ROI goals. This is because they, and those they care most about, directly experience the benefits of their LCB’s investments growing the vitality of the community commons.

We create a new mindset: “Building my community into a healthy and sustainable place, and sharing in the social credit for that accomplishment, is as important to me as my own individual benefit.” This mindset will grow stronger as people experience that making their communities healthier and more sustainable also has the effect of increasing their own individual benefit. People will voluntarily choose simpler, lower-impact lifestyles, and refocus their personal satisfaction goals toward membership in their heroic integrated community, and in attaining satisfying human relationships within it.

An LCB investor’s conversations with other community members about their investments is a powerful influence vector for environment- and community-positive lifestyle changes among their neighbors and friends in a community.

**IMPACT VECTOR C:**

**Large scale government and institutional investment (Indirect Impact)**

[Once 3.5% of the adult population](http://newstoryhub.com/2019/07/the-3-5-rule-how-a-small-minority-can-change-the-world/) in a nation or more are engaged as investors in LCBs throughout a country, we expect that to have a catalytic effect on larger-scale government and private sector institutional investments, because our primary investors are their voters and customers.

Globally, we aim to channel 5% of the assets of the global middle class and poor into climate- and environment-smart investments by 2025. The Axios-estimated cost of addressing climate change alone is 45 trillion USD, while our 5% would amount to only 6 trillion USD. That 6 trillion, however, is the key to unlocking the further 39 trillion from governments and the major corporates which they regulate. When enough people are willingly participating with a significant share of their assets in LCB investments, we expect their governments and major corporate suppliers of good and service suppliers to move as well, to keep their goodwill and patronage.

If we are strong enough in our actions through LCBs above to gain 171,500,000 LCB investors spread out globally, we think that will be inspiration for governments to invest an amount six times greater than our own, reaching the needed investment of $45T in the five years between 2035 and 2030 as government investments grow.

**IMPACT VECTOR D: Financially fueling the global network of change agents working toward climate and environmental mitigation. (Direct Impact)**

To achieve their goals, LCBs will need many of the kinds of skilled services already being provided by already-existing members of the non-profit, for-profit and public sectors. Examples include: regenerative and sustainable investment advisory services particularly in all the domains described in Impact Vector A above; scientific consultancy needed to prioritize local climate and environmental issues; community organization and mobilization consultancy and local language translation, interpretation and cultural interpretation services. Rather than re-creating these capabilities in house, LCBs will seek as far as possible to partner with existing world-positive organizations to help achieve LCB investment goals and—when their activities directly line up with our impact goals and can return an acceptable ROI to our investors—to finance them directly.

*Our unique focus and **mission** within this organizational ecosystem is:*

*We generate locally-sourced and locally-invested finance for climate and environmental impact.*

# **Steps to Establish LCB and LCB GN Feasibility**

[Untitled](https://www.notion.so/9a5b0f37562941e4ae8bc53887fd8e7e)

**April 2020 Launch of the CCIF and the LCB Global Network** 

We expect that the CCIF business plan created with the seed grant funding will show the requirement of a Startup Fund of approximately $60 million USD for one year, and that the plan will show that this investment could achieve deployment of first-year householder investments of $60 billion USD into the flight to mitigate climate change and ecological collapse, and make communities resilient.

We have a capable fundraising team willing to raise the large startup budget required, who in the past raised funds in the hundreds of millions from the development finance arms of national governments. In addition to targeting appropriate government actors, to raise our startup operating budget we will target large NGOs, large climate and environment investors, and deploy a crowd-funding initiative.

Our now-ready Fund Development team first requires us to have a well-developed business plan and the founding executive team to stand behind it.
